# Chat Room Application

This is a simple chat room application implemented in Java. The application consists of a server and a client that communicate over a network to enable users to send and receive messages in a chat room.

## Entry Point

The entry point for the program is the `main` method in the `Server` class for the server and the `Client` class for the client.

## How to Run

### Server

1. Run the server: Modify Run arguments
    ```bash
    <port>
    ```
   Replace `<port>` with the desired port number (e.g., 1234).

### Client

1. Run the client: Modify Run Arguments

    ```bash
    <host> <port>
    ```

   Replace `<host>` with the server's hostname or IP address and `<port>` with the server's port number.
   For example, host = localhost port = 1234
